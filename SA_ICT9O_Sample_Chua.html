			<th><ul>
           <li>Was the former curate of the parish church of San Diego. </li>
           <li>Padre Damaso was known to be friendly with the Ibarra family, so much that Crisóstomo was surprised by what the former curate had done to Don Rafaél.</li>

        	<th>Pilósopo Tasyo</th>
			<th><ul>
           <li>Is one of the most important characters in Noli. </li>
           <li>He is referred to as a philosopher/sage (hence, Pilosopo Tasyo) because his ideas were accurate with the minds of the townspeople</li>
           <li> His mother let him be formally educated, then abruptly ordered him to stop. She feared Tasyo would become "too educated" and lose his faith and devotion to religion.</li>

			<th><ul>
           <li>Came from the family which the Ibarra clan had oppressed for generations. </li>
           <li>He grew up in a wealthy family until he discovered something that changed his life forever.</li>
           <li>Elias and Ibarra continued supporting each other until Elias sacrificed himself to help him one last time he was shot by the guards (mistakenly took as Ibarra trying to dive down the river and escape) and slowly died.</li>
